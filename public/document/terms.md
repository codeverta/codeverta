**B. Detailed Instructions for Proper Candle Usage**

For a safe and enjoyable experience with our candles, please adhere to the following usage instructions. Before lighting, always trim the wick to ¼ inch.<sup>20</sup> This helps prevent uneven burning, dripping, and sooting. Ensure the candle is placed on a stable, level, heat-resistant surface away from drafts, vents, ceiling fans, and air currents.<sup>20</sup> Allow the candle to burn for at least 2 hours or until a full wax pool forms across the surface, especially during the first burn. This prevents tunneling and ensures an even burn for subsequent uses.<sup>20</sup> Do not burn the candle for more than four consecutive hours to prevent overheating of the container.<sup>20</sup> Keep the wax pool free of wick trimmings, matches, and any other debris.<sup>20</sup> Discontinue use when only ½ inch of wax remains at the bottom of the container to prevent the risk of the glass cracking or breaking.<sup>40</sup> Always extinguish the candle by smothering the flame with a snuffer or gently blowing it out, ensuring no embers remain.<sup>20</sup> Never use water to extinguish a candle, as this can cause the hot wax to splatter and may break the glass container.<sup>20</sup> Allow the candle to cool completely before handling or relighting.<sup>20</sup>
